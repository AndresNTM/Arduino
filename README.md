# Arduino_NRF24L01
This is the sample code from a youtube tutorial on how to use the NRF24L01 to control a servo motor.

This code is as simple as possible. There are many opportunities to increase the error handling along with error correction. Those would complicate the code beyond what is ideal for focusing on the core concept of getting the damn thing to work.

This ties into a Youtube tutorial at:

For simplicity the wire colours used in the Fritzing diagrams are identical to those wires used in the project.
